<h2 id="intro">ðŸŽ‰ Introduction</h2>
KTransformers, pronounced as Quick Transformers, is designed to enhance your ðŸ¤— <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers">Transformers</a> experience with advanced kernel optimizations and placement/parallelism strategies.
<br/><br/>
KTransformers is a flexible, Python-centric framework designed with extensibility at its core. 
By implementing and injecting an optimized module with a single line of code, users gain access to a Transformers-compatible
interface, RESTful APIs compliant with OpenAI and Ollama, and even a simplified ChatGPT-like web UI. 
<br/><br/>
Our vision for KTransformers is to serve as a flexible platform for experimenting with innovative LLM inference optimizations. Please let us know if you need any other features.
