# Security Policy

This document provides an overview of the security policy of Kompute.

Kompute aims to follow the two following policies:

* Keep dependencies up to date
* Identify and address common vulnerabilities and exposures 

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you identify a vulnerability the best way to report it is by sending an email to the team via a@ethical.institute. The discussion can then take place there on next steps (ie updating library, reaching out to 3rd party projects, etc).
